## Math introduction

Modulo arithmetics

1. $0^2 = 0, (\pm 1)^2 = 1, (\pm 2)^2 = 4, (\pm 3)^2 = 9 = 1, (\pm 4)^2 = 16 = 0$ mod 8.
    <ol type="1">
        <li> It's true that all odd squares are 1 mod 8. It can be checked by calculating all squares of the remainders mod 8 (see above). </li>
        <li> Either 0 or 4 (calculations above)</li>
    </ol>

3. Big $O$ describes how much some value (e.g time, space) changes depending on another value $n$ as $n \rightarrow +\infty$. For the proof the preferable size would be the smallest, which is $O(1)$ - meaning the size of the proof is limited by a constant.
    <ol type="1">
        <li> O(n) - (let's say) the time is proportional to n, meaning that when n increases, in the worst-case scenario the time can be evaluated (limited by) C*n, where C is independent of n constant </li>
        <li> O(1) - the time can be limited by some constant which is independent of n, namely time < C </li>
        <li> O(n^2) - the time is proportional to n^2, meaning that when n increases, in the worst-case scenario the time can be evaluated (limited by) C*n^2, where C is independent of n constant
        </li>
    </ol>
