## Math introduction

Modulo arithmetics

1. I assume that the exercise implies the group $\mathbb{Z}_7 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ with "+" defined as in modulo arithmetics.
    <ol type="A">
        <li>4 + 4 = 1</li>
        <li>3 * 5 = 1</li>
        <li>inverse of 3 is 4 (-3 = 4 because 3 + 4 = 0 in this group)</li>
    </ol>

2.  Whether $S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ is a group depends on how "+" is defined. If it's the usual sum, then, for example, 5 + 6 = 11 is not in the set, thus it's not a group. If defined through modulo arithmetics, it's the group $\mathbb{Z}_7$.

3. -13 = 2 mod 5

4. $p(x) = x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 12$. Calculate $p(2) = 0$, this 2 is a root. The degree of $p$ is 3.
