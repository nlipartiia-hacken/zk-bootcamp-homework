## Stark Theory

1. If we imagine the table with _Step, Amount, Total_ columns and represent rows as $i$, columns as $j$ and the values as $A_{i,j}$, the constrains look like:
$$
A_{0, 2} = 0, \\
A_{i, 2} - A_{i, 1} - A_{i-1, 2} = 0, \\
A_{6, 2} = 12.
$$

2. The polynomial is defined as $p(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 - 4x + 20$. It's easy to verify that 2 is a root, namely $p(2) = 0$. Thus $p$ can be represented as
$$
p(x) = (x - 2)q(x),
$$
where
$$
q(x) = x^2 - 3x - 10.
$$
Here $\deg p(x) = 3$ and $\deg q(x) = 2$.
